## 1b
**_The programming languages that I know are python,MATLAB,SPS(Spectral Plasma Solver),and CPIC. The langauge that I am most comfortable with is python._**

## 1c
**_From this class, I hope to gain few skillsets. I expect to expand on my programming and simulation skills that will support advance physics topics. I am most excited about is utilizing new robust techniques to help solve my PhD research topic. Specifically, I want to focus on learning how to model plasma acceleration.I believe this class will be very impactful for my career!!_**
